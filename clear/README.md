# HTML5 Clear

Work in progress. See `TODO.md` for features not implemented yet. See it in action: [http://clear.evanyou.me](http://clear.evanyou.me).

You can also watch [the original HTML5 Clear video](https://vimeo.com/37182785).

The [original iOS app](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/) is designed and developed by [Realmac Software](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/) in collaboration with [Helftone](http://helftone.com) and [Impending, Inc.](http://impending.com). This project is simply a personal attempt to test my limit in building intricate interfaces with HTML5.
